## Accordions

{{< accordion_controls >}}

{{< accordion_start title="Accordion Example - Continuous Monitoring" >}}
In continuous monitoring, air quality is constantly measured by drawing air in through various tubes that are connected to data loggers that automatically transmit the data to a central MOE database. The data is automatically checked for errors and is published hourly on the Current Air Data page, where it is available to the public, and used to calculate the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI).

This data is useful for providing real-time information and for calculating indexes. However, until it goes through the MOE's data validation process, it is still considered raw data and should not be used for comparing to air quality guidelines or objectives.

The province uses a wide range of automated instruments to collect and measure air quality data, including the following (with instrument acronyms and parameters measured in parenthesis):

-   Tempered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) (PM2.5 and PM10)
-   Beta AttenuatedMonitoring (BAM) (PM2.5)
-   UV Photometry (ozone)
-   Chemiluminscence (nitrogen dioxide)
-   UV Fluorescence (sulphur dioxide)
-   Nondispersive Infrared Photometry (carbon monoxide)
-   Pulsed Fluorescence (total reduced sulphur or H2S)
