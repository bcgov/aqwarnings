The Ministry of Environment and Parks in collaboration with the Interior
Health Authority has issued an Air Quality Warning for Kelowna due to
elevated ground level ozone.

Exposure to ground level ozone is particularly a concern for infants,
older adults, individuals with chronic conditions (such as asthma, COPD,
heart disease, and diabetes) or respiratory infections, and those who
are pregnant. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or
acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the
warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or
throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or
wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.
Staying indoors helps to reduce exposure.

This is a TEST - not an actual warning

The next update will be on November 07, 2025 and posted to the
province's [Air Quality Warnings
webpage](https://www.gov.bc.ca/airquality).

Visit the provincial [air quality data
webpage](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air/air-quality)
for real-time observations.

## Actions you can take

As air contaminant levels increase, health risks increase. Consider
reducing or rescheduling outdoor sports, activities and events.

People more likely to be negatively impacted by outdoor air pollution
should reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors or seek
medical attention if experiencing symptoms. This includes people aged 65
and older, pregnant individuals, infants and young children, people with
an existing illness or chronic health condition such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and diabetes, and
people who work outdoors.

{{< accordion_controls >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Follow your common sense" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes
    uncomfortable or you feel unwell.

-   Always carry any rescue medications with you.

-   Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves
    follow the same advice.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Monitor your symptoms" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Different people have different responses to elevated levels of air
    contaminants.
-   Mild irritation and discomfort such as eye, nose and throat
    irritation, headaches or a mild cough are common, and usually
    disappear when the air contaminants return to typical levels.
-   More serious but less common symptoms include wheezing, chest pains
    or severe cough.
-   People with asthma or other chronic illness should follow any
    personal care plans designed with their family physicians.
-   If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC
    at 8-1-1.
-   If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or
    discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your physician, walk-in
    clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical
    emergency, call 9-1-1.

{{< accordion_start title="Tips to reduce your exposure to air pollution" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Air contaminant levels may be lower indoors but will still be
    elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.
-   When indoors, keep windows and doors closed as much as possible.

## Emission reduction actions

{{< accordion_start title="Mandatory actions" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Facilities with air discharge authorizations under the Environmental
    Management Act are required to follow trigger actions within their
    permit related to Air Quality Warnings and are encouraged to reduce
    any other emissions where possible.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Voluntary actions" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Fuel your vehicle in the cooler evening hours or after dark.
-   Reduce or reschedule using other gasoline and diesel equipment, such
    as lawn mowers, trimmers and leaf blowers.

## More information

{{< accordion_start title="Current conditions" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

Ground-level ozone is formed when chemicals (such as nitrogen oxides and
volatile organic compounds) react in the air when there is sunlight.
Nitrogen oxides are emitted from vehicles, boilers, building heating,
and other combustion processes. VOCs are emitted from burning fossil
fuels, evaporation of solvents (including paint, varnishes and
thinners), refining and storing fuel and agricultural activities. VOCs
also come from natural sources such as vegetation.

The highest concentrations of ground-level ozone usually happen between
mid-afternoon and early evening on summer days.

The provincial air quality objectives for ozone is an eight-hour
objective of 62 parts per billion (ppb) and a one-hour average of 82 ppb
for air quality warnings. Air quality warnings for ground-level ozone
may be issued when current concentrations exceed or are expected to
exceed either of these objectives.

The 8-hour average ozone concentration and 1-hour maximum concentration
(within the past 8 hours) are summarized below for Kelowna and nearest
monitored communities at 2:00 PM local time today:

  Community                Kelowna   Kamloops   Vernon
  ------------------------ --------- ---------- --------
  8-hr average (ppb)       13.1      23.7       11.2
  Max. within 8 hr (ppb)   24.4      37.9       26.3
