{{< inline_alert_start>}} Please see the [PDF version of this Air
Quality Warning](/warnings/2025-11-04_end_o3_obr_Kamloops.pdf) for the

{{< inline_alert_end >}}

The Ministry of Environment and Parks in collaboration with the Interior
Health Authority has ended the Air Quality Warning and open burning
restrictions that were issued on November 03, 2025 for Kamloops due to
elevated levels of ground level ozone.

Local air quality has improved due to changing meteorological
conditions.

# More information

-   The provincial air quality objectives for ozone is an eight-hour
    objective of 62 parts per billion (ppb) and a one-hour average of 82
    ppb for air quality advisories. Air quality advisories for
    ground-level ozone may be issued when current concentrations exceed
    or are expected to exceed either of these objectives.
-   The 8-hour average ozone concentration and 1-hour maximum
    concentration (within the past 8 hours) are summarized below for
    Kamloops and nearest monitored communities at 10:00 AM local time
    today:

  Community                Kamloops   Quesnel   Williams Lake
  ------------------------ ---------- --------- ---------------
  8-hr average (ppb)       0.6        1.6       3.5
  Max. within 8 hr (ppb)   2.0        3.1       6.2
