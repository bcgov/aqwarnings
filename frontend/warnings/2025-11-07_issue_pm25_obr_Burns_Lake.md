The Ministry of Environment and Parks in collaboration with the Northern
Health Authority has issued an Air Quality Warning for Burns Lake due to
elevated fine particulate matter.

Exposure to fine particulate matter is particularly a concern for
infants, older adults, individuals with chronic conditions (such as
asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes) or respiratory infections,
and those who are pregnant. Persons with chronic underlying medical
conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous
exercise until the warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such
as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of
breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care
provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce exposure.

Open burning restrictions are now in effect within 50 km of the Burns
Lake firehall. No new fires may be initiated, and no additional material
may be added to existing fires. For more information on burning
restrictions, refer to the Mandatory Emission Reduction Actions section
below.

Current conditions are expected to persist until weather conditions
change and/or local emissions are reduced.

The next update will be on November 08, 2025 and posted to the
province's [Air Quality Warnings
webpage](https://www.gov.bc.ca/airquality).

Visit the provincial [air quality data
webpage](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air/air-quality)
for real-time observations.

## Actions you can take

As air contaminant levels increase, health risks increase. Consider
reducing or rescheduling outdoor sports, activities and events.

People more likely to be negatively impacted by outdoor air pollution
should reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors or seek
medical attention if experiencing symptoms. This includes people aged 65
and older, pregnant individuals, infants and young children, people with
an existing illness or chronic health condition such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and diabetes, and
people who work outdoors.

{{< accordion_controls >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Follow your common sense" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes
    uncomfortable or you feel unwell.

-   Always carry any rescue medications with you.

-   Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves
    follow the same advice.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Monitor your symptoms" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Different people have different responses to elevated levels of air
    contaminants.
-   Mild irritation and discomfort such as eye, nose and throat
    irritation, headaches or a mild cough are common, and usually
    disappear when the air contaminants return to typical levels.
-   More serious but less common symptoms include wheezing, chest pains
    or severe cough.
-   People with asthma or other chronic illness should follow any
    personal care plans designed with their family physicians.
-   If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC
    at 8-1-1.
-   If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or
    discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your physician, walk-in
    clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical
    emergency, call 9-1-1.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Tips to reduce your exposure to air pollution" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Air contaminant levels may be lower indoors but will still be
    elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.

-   When indoors, keep windows and doors closed as much as possible.

-   Protect your indoor air from outdoor air pollution. Actions can
    include using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation
    system and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine
    particles. Do-it-yourself air cleaners may also be used if other
    options are not available. For details, visit: https://rb.gy/epi7qv.

-   If you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting
    and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified
    N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to
    particulate matter. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can
    still be risks to health.

-   Avoid roads with heavy vehicle traffic and areas with wood smoke.

## Emission reduction actions

{{< accordion_start title="Mandatory actions" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Facilities with air discharge authorizations under the Environmental
    Management Act are required to follow trigger actions within their
    permit related to Air Quality Warnings and are encouraged to reduce
    any other emissions where possible.

-   Burns Lake bylaw 871 restricts the use of wood burning appliances
    during air quality advisories:

    -   **6a**: No person shall use a Wood Burning Appliance at any time
        when an air quality advisory is in effect, except to heat the
        premises that are equipped with no heating appliance or
        facilities other than the Wood Burning Appliance.

    -   Contact the Burns Lake municipal office at
        [250-692-7587](tel:2506927587) for more information on woodstove
        restrictions.

-   As pollution is occurring or is likely to occur from open burning,
    pursuant to Sections 30(1) and 30(2) of the Open Burning Smoke
    Control Regulation, the Director has prohibited open burning within
    50 km of the Burns Lake firehall until November 09, 2025 12:00 PM
    local time. No vegetative debris may be ignited or added to ignited
    piles. Contravention of these provisions may be subject to a fine
    under the Regulation.

-   Please see the [PDF version of this Air Quality
    Warning](/warnings/2025-11-07_issue_pm25_obr_Burns_Lake.pdf) for the
    statutory decision-maker sign-off related to open burning
    restrictions.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Voluntary actions" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Avoid using wood stoves and fireplaces unless it is the sole heating
    source. If wood burning is the sole heating source, burn dry,
    seasoned wood and ensure an adequate supply of combustion air.
-   Reduce vehicle use where possible and avoid idling vehicles.

## More information

{{< accordion_start title="Current conditions" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

Fine particulate matter refers to airborne solid or liquid droplets with
diameters of 2.5 micrometers (μm) or less. PM~2.5~ levels tend to be
highest around busy roads, industrial operations and neighbourhoods with
residential wood burning. PM~2.5~ can easily penetrate indoors because
of their small size. Common sources of PM~2.5~ that contribute to
episodes of poor air quality vary seasonally but can include wood smoke
(from wood stoves and/or open burning) as well as emissions from
industry and transportation sources such as automobiles, trucks and rail
traffic.

The provincial air quality objective for PM~2.5~ is 25 micrograms per
cubic metre (μg/m^3^) averaged over 24 hours. 24-hour average PM~2.5~
concentrations are summarized below for Burns Lake and nearest monitored
communities at 10:00 AM local time today:
