## Be informed

During a wildfire, smoke conditions can change quickly over short
distances and can vary considerably hour-by-hour.

Wildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is important
to be mindful that exposure to smoke may affect your health.

People with pre-existing health conditions, respiratory infections such
as COVID-19, older adults, pregnant women and infants, children, and
sensitive individuals are more likely to experience health effects from
smoke exposure.

## During smoky conditions

{{< accordion_controls >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Follow your common sense" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes
    uncomfortable or you feel unwell.

-   Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.

-   If you have asthma or other chronic illness, carry any rescue
    (fast-acting) medications with you at all times and activate your
    personal care plan that has been designed with your family
    physician.

-   Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves
    follow the same advice.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Monitor your symptoms" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort
    are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.

-   If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC
    at 8-1-1.

-   If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or
    discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider,
    walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical
    emergency, call 9-1-1.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Tips to reduce your smoke exposure" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so
    stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.

-   Running a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate
    air) filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the
    device is located.

-   If you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may
    help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously.

-   Reduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning
    incense, and frying foods.

-   Consider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with
    cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke.

-   If travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up
    and the ventilation set to recirculate.

-   If you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another
    location with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change
    rapidly.

-   Maintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health
    effects resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution.
