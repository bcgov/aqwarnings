The Ministry of Environment and Parks in collaboration with the Interior
Health Authority has ended the Air Quality Warning that was issued on

matter.

Local air quality has improved due to changing meteorological
conditions.

Open burning restrictions remain in effect within 50 km of the Golden
hospital. No new fires may be initiated, and no additional material may
be added to existing fires. For more information on burning
restrictions, refer to the Mandatory Emission Reduction Actions section
