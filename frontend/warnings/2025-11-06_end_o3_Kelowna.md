The Ministry of Environment and Parks in collaboration with the Interior
Health Authority has ended the Air Quality Warning that was issued on
November 04, 2025 for Kelowna due to elevated levels of ground level
ozone.

This is a TEST - not an actual warning

## More information

{{< accordion_start title="Current conditions" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   The provincial air quality objectives for ozone is an eight-hour
    objective of 62 parts per billion (ppb) and a one-hour average of 82
    ppb for air quality advisories. Air quality advisories for
    ground-level ozone may be issued when current concentrations exceed
    or are expected to exceed either of these objectives.
-   The 8-hour average ozone concentration and 1-hour maximum
    concentration (within the past 8 hours) are summarized below for
    Kelowna and nearest monitored communities at 10:00 AM local time
    today:

  Community                Kelowna   Kamloops   Vernon
  ------------------------ --------- ---------- --------
  8-hr average (ppb)       2.6       11.2       0.0
  Max. within 8 hr (ppb)   5.0       27.3       4.4
