## Actions you can take

As smoke levels increase, health risks increase. Limit time outdoors.
Consider reducing or rescheduling outdoor sports, activities and events.

People more likely to be negatively impacted by outdoor air pollution
should reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors or seek
medical attention if experiencing symptoms. This includes people aged 65
and older, pregnant individuals, infants and young children, people with
an existing illness or chronic health condition such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and diabetes, and
people who work outdoors.

## During smoky conditions

{{< accordion_controls >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Follow your common sense" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes
    uncomfortable or you feel unwell.

-   Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.

-   Carry any rescue medications with you at all times.

-   Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves
    follow the same advice.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Monitor your symptoms" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Different people have different responses to smoke.

-   Mild irritation and discomfort such as eye, nose and throat
    irritation, headaches or a mild cough are common, and usually
    disappear when the smoke clears.

-   More serious but less common symptoms include wheezing, chest pains
    or severe cough.

-   People with asthma or other chronic illness should follow any
    personal care plans designed with their family physicians.

-   If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC
    at 8-1-1.

-   If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or
    discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your physician, walk-in
    clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical
    emergency, call 9-1-1.

{{< accordion_end >}}
{{< accordion_start title="Tips to reduce your smoke exposure" initiallyOpen="true" >}}

-   Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so
    stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.

-   When indoors, keep windows and doors closed as much as possible.

-   When there is an extreme heat event occurring with poor air quality,
    prioritize keeping cool.

-   Protect your indoor air from wildfire smoke. Actions can include
    using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation system
    and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine
    particles.

-   If you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting
    and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified
    N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to the fine
    particles in the smoke. Even though exposure may be reduced, there
    can still be risks to health.

-   Check on others who are in your care or live nearby who may be more
    likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke.

-   Always follow guidance from local authorities.
