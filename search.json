    "text": "The Ministry of Environment and Parks in collaboration with the Northern Health Authority issued an Air Quality Warning for Vanderhoof on January 26, 2026. The warning remains in effect due to elevated fine particulate matter.\nExposure to fine particulate matter is particularly a concern for infants, older adults, individuals with chronic conditions (such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes) or respiratory infections, and those who are pregnant. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce exposure.\nFine particulate matter levels have improved since 10:00 AM this morning however levels have not yet remained consistently low enough to end the warning. Current conditions are expected to persist until weather conditions change and/or local emissions are reduced.\nThe next update will be on January 28, 2026 and posted to the province’s Air Quality Warnings webpage.\nVisit the provincial air quality data webpage for real-time observations."

    "text": "The Ministry of Environment and Parks in collaboration with the Northern Health Authority has issued an Air Quality Warning for Valemount due to elevated fine particulate matter.\nExposure to fine particulate matter is particularly a concern for infants, older adults, individuals with chronic conditions (such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes) or respiratory infections, and those who are pregnant. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce exposure.\nAir quality will be most affected in the morning and evening. These conditions will likely continue until weather changes or local emissions decrease.\nThe next update will be on January 17, 2026 and posted to the province’s Air Quality Warnings webpage.\nVisit the provincial air quality data webpage for real-time observations."

Actions can include using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation system and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles. Do-it-yourself air cleaners may also be used if other options are unavailable. For more details, see the BC Centre of Control fact sheet.\nIf you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to particulate matter. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can still be risks to health.\nAvoid roads with heavy vehicle traffic and areas with wood smoke."

The warning remains in effect due to elevated fine particulate matter.\nExposure to fine particulate matter is particularly a concern for infants, older adults, individuals with chronic conditions (such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes) or respiratory infections, and those who are pregnant. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.

Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.

PM10 can easily penetrate indoors because of their small size.\nThe current dusty conditions are caused by road traffic stirring up winter traction materials that have accumulated on roadways over the past winter.\nThe provincial air quality objective for PM10 is 50 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3), averaged over 24 hours. 24-hour average PM10 concentrations are summarized below for Smithers and nearest monitored communities at 12:00 PM local time today:\n\n\n\nCommunity\nSmithers\nBurns Lake\nHouston\n\n\n\n\n24-hr average (μg/m3)\n58.6\n24.7\n21.6\n\n\n\n\nFor additional information about air quality in British Columbia:\n\nAir Quality Health Index Provincial summary of latest index and forecast.\nWhat’s the air like today?

    "text": "The Ministry of Environment and Parks in collaboration with the Northern Health Authority issued an Air Quality Warning for Prince George on January 18, 2026. The warning remains in effect due to elevated fine particulate matter.\nExposure to fine particulate matter is particularly a concern for infants, older adults, individuals with chronic conditions (such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes) or respiratory infections, and those who are pregnant. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce exposure.\nFine particulate matter concentrations have dipped slightly below the 24‑hour provincial objective, but air quality remains a concern as levels have been rising in recent hours. These conditions are expected to persist until the weather changes or local emissions decrease.\nThe next update will be on January 21, 2026 and posted to the province’s Air Quality Warnings webpage.\nVisit the provincial air quality data webpage for real-time observations."

The warning remains in effect due to elevated fine particulate matter.\nExposure to fine particulate matter is particularly a concern for infants, older adults, individuals with chronic conditions (such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes) or respiratory infections, and those who are pregnant. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the warning is ended. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.

PM2.5 levels tend to be highest around busy roads, industrial operations and neighbourhoods with residential wood burning. PM2.5 can easily penetrate indoors because of their small size. Common sources of PM2.5 that contribute to episodes of poor air quality vary seasonally but can include wood smoke (from wood stoves and/or open burning) as well as emissions from industry and transportation sources such as automobiles, trucks and rail traffic.\nThe provincial air quality objective for PM2.5 is 25 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) averaged over 24 hours. 24-hour average PM2.5 concentrations are summarized below for Vanderhoof and nearest monitored communities at 9:00 AM local time today:\n\n\n\nCommunity\nVanderhoof\nBurns Lake\nPrince George\n\n\n\n\n24-hr average (μg/m3)\n25.1\n12.6\n21.2\n\n\n\n\nFor additional information about air quality in British Columbia:\n\nAir Quality Health Index Provincial summary of latest index and forecast.\nWhat’s the air like today?

For more details, see the BC Centre of Control fact sheet.\nIf you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to particulate matter. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can still be risks to health.\nAvoid roads with heavy vehicle traffic and areas with wood smoke."

Together with fine particulate matter (airborne solid or liquid droplets with diameters of 2.5 μm or less), these particles are referred to as PM10. Sources of PM10 contributing to this air quality episode include road dust from the emission of winter traction material along busy and dry road surfaces. PM10 can easily penetrate indoors because of their small size.\nThe current dusty conditions are caused by road traffic stirring up winter traction materials that have accumulated on roadways over the past winter.\nThe provincial air quality objective for PM10 is 50 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3), averaged over 24 hours. 24-hour average PM10 concentrations are summarized below for Smithers and nearest monitored communities at 7:00 AM local time today:\n\n\n\nCommunity\nSmithers\nBurns Lake\nHouston\n\n\n\n\n24-hr average (μg/m3)\n65.1\n20.6\n18.7\n\n\n\n\nFor additional information about air quality in British Columbia:\n\nAir Quality Health Index Provincial summary of latest index and forecast.\nWhat’s the air like today?

Actions can include using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation system and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles. Do-it-yourself air cleaners may also be used if other options are unavailable. For more details, see the BC Centre of Control fact sheet.\nIf you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to particulate matter. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can still be risks to health.\nAvoid roads with heavy vehicle traffic and areas with wood smoke."

This includes people aged 65 and older, pregnant individuals, infants and young children, people with an existing illness or chronic health condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and diabetes, and people who work outdoors."

    "text": "During smoky conditions\nExpand AllCollapse All Follow your common sense\n\nStop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes uncomfortable or you feel unwell.\nStay cool and drink plenty of fluids.\nCarry any rescue medications with you at all times.\nMake sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice.\n\n Monitor your symptoms\n\nDifferent people have different responses to smoke.\nMild irritation and discomfort such as eye, nose and throat irritation, headaches or a mild cough are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\nMore serious but less common symptoms include wheezing, chest pains or severe cough.\nPeople with asthma or other chronic illness should follow any personal care plans designed with their family physicians.\nIf you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.\nIf you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your physician, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\n Tips to reduce your smoke exposure\n\nSmoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\nWhen indoors, keep windows and doors closed as much as possible.\nWhen there is an extreme heat event occurring with poor air quality, prioritize keeping cool.\nProtect your indoor air from wildfire smoke. Actions can include using a clean, good quality air filter in your ventilation system and/or a certified portable air cleaner that can filter fine particles.\nIf you must spend time outdoors, a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent respirator) can reduce your exposure to the fine particles in the smoke. Even though exposure may be reduced, there can still be risks to health.\nCheck on others who are in your care or live nearby who may be more likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke.\nAlways follow guidance from local authorities."
